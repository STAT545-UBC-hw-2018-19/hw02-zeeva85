About this page
================

Welcome to my STAT545 private repository. This repository will primarily contain the study materials and assignments associated with [STAT545][Stat545Link].

These are the links to the privious weeks participation for the STAT545A class and the `R markdown` file for the part 2 of the assignment.

About me
--------

My name is **Seevasant (Seeva) Indran**. I am from Kuala lumpur, Malaysia :malaysia:. I came to Vancouver in September 2017 to pursue a Masters in **Genome Science and Technology (GSAT)**. I did my undergraduate in Melbourne, Australia. I have previously worked on projects exploring bacteriophages associated _Helicobacter pylori_ genetic plasticity and their association in Gastric cancer at the Marshall center and Intergrin mechanotransduction in Mesenchymal Stem cell at the Tissue Engineering Group, University of Malaya. 

If you are interested, my publications are below:-


1. [Helicobacter pylori Genetic Diversity and Gastro-duodenal Diseases in Malaysia][Hpylori]
2. [Potential of apoptotic pathway-targeted cancer therapeutic research: Where do we stand?][CancerReview]

[CancerReview]: https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2015275

I am currently attached to the [**Loewen lab**][loewenlablink] which is located at the Life Sciences Institute working on evaluating the significance of unknown variances (SUV) in cancer drivers using _Sacharomyces Cerevisiae_ (yeast) as a model organism. Yeast is an ideal model organism because it is easy to genetically perturb genes in yeast, it has a high growth rate which means, experiments can be conducted in a shorter frame of time. It is the only organism that has a genome-wide knockout of every (non-esential) gene. Eventhough it doesnt not have all the human genes, the [table][ChoromosomeNumberTbl] below clearly shows that the complexity of an organism is not defined by how many chromosome, the number of genes  or even the size its genome. Additionally over the years, many human genes that are not naturally present has be inserted or complemented in yeast to study funtional global genetic interaction for the identification of intractive nodes and its clusters.

## Interest

Besides being a :nerd_face: I also enjoy:-

- Playing the Guitar, picture of [me][AccousticGig] in an acoustic session.
	- If you are looking to form a band or just jam, [hear][RandomSolo] me out, hopefully it should give you an idea of what I can bring into the jamming sessions. Altenatively, [here][YoutubeLink] and [here][RandomSolo2] are some more links.
- Cooking and experimenting with new dishes.
- Playing Soccer and watching soccer.

## Reflections

### Why am I in this course ? 

Learning `r` is an essential part for data exploration in high-throughput biology. [STAT545][Stat545Link] would offer me some experience in gaining some ground towards building familiarity and expertise in data wranggling with data exploration and visualization tools such as the `ggplot` package. My goal(s) towards the end of this class is hopefully :crossed_fingers: be able to produce genome wide interaction mapping shown below with the data from my own research.

> My primary passion is to seek out the mysteries and the intricacies that are allusively governing the universe. I have chosen biology as a platform of my curiosity.

Hopefully I also will be able to turn it into something like this just because it is cool :sunglasses:

## STAT545A Learning outcome checklist ..

1. [x] Learn some basic markdown
2. [x] share markdown tricks with the class
	* `[![ImageName](ImagePath/link)](link to site)` 
		* This produces a clickable image, where the image and the link are both from websites. Look at my Twitter, Youtube and LinkedIn example at the bottom of the page for an example. 

2. [x] Learn some basic `R markdown `
3. [x] Share some useful code with the class
	* `rm (list = ls())` 
		*	 The fucntion above clears all the assigned variables in the RStudio environment. The `ls()` list all the variable in the enviroment, and it is removed when assigned to the argument `list = ` within the `rm()` fucntion.
